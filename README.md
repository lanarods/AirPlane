Airplane Seating Assignment: Write a program that can be used to
assign seats for a commercial airplane. The airplane has 13 rows, with 6
seats in each row. Rows 1 and 2 are first class, rows 3 to 7 are business class,
and rows 8 to 13 are economy class. Your program prompts the user to
enter the following information:
a. Ticket type (first class, business class, or economy class)
b. Desired seat
* indicates that the seat is available; X indicates that the seat has been
assigned. Make this a menu-driven program; show the userâ€™s choices and
allow the user to make the appropriate choices.
